### Day 2: Basic nbconvert Demonstration

This script demonstrates the use of `nbconvert` to convert a Jupyter notebook into a Markdown file. While functional for simple notebooks, it highlights key limitations:

- Interactive outputs (e.g., Plotly) are not preserved.
- Embedded images or large outputs may not render correctly.

These findings motivated the development of Notebookify to address such challenges.
